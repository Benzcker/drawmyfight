# drawmyfight
You can draw the animations for two stick figures and this simulation will let them fight against each other.

Tutorial isn't done yet! I'll see, if I'll get the time to finish it. The text for it is already written.

Also there could be pleanty of improvements made. I just don't have the time to do them.
